# λCoin

A decentralised cloud network to store and execute functions within a containerised environment.

This will allow computations to be performed on demand on a decentralised cloud network as you would with AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions or Microsoft Azure Functions.

Cloud computing is owned by these big 3 corporations and there is little room for anyone else. This monopoly of cloud infrastructure is unjustified as internet enables peer to peer transmission of data and networking which is under utilised. We choose to build only centralised applications as it is easiest to deploy, distribute and scale.

Taking the lead, from IFPS and Filecoin which is seeking to create such a marketplace for storage — λCoin will create a marketplace on-top of its Function Execution Network.

### Topics to cover

- Environments though Configuration pools
- Immutable Storage through the blockchain
- Reliability through parallelisation
- Security through end to end encryption
- Execution through transactions
- Verification through proofs
- Incentives through tokens
